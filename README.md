# CircuitsSolver
A tool to simulate simple AC circuits.

The project objective is to develop a CAD (Computer Aided Design) tool to simulate simple AC circuits that contains only (independent voltage sources, independent current sources, dependent voltage source, dependent current source, resistors, capacitors, and inductors).

IMPORTANT NOTE : You MUST install Eigen on your environment to run the code.
